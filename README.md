Pymaceutical Analysis
•	The Capomulin drug outperforms the other drugs when reviewing how many mice are observed over the 45-day trial period. Mice that were given the Capomulin drug were likely to make it to the end of the trial.
•	For the mice on the Capomulin drug the data shows that there is a positive relationship between mice weight and avg tumor volume. The more the mouse weighs the bigger the tumor volume is. 
•	The Ramicane drug is competitive with the Capomulin drug. Mice on Ramicane on average have smaller tumor volumes and their results appear constant as their tumor outliers do not have a high variance.  
•	There were about 1% more males that received the drugs than females.
